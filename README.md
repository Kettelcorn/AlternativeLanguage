  I picked C++ as my language using C++ 14. I picked this programming language because I have been learning how to program in Unreal Engine, which utilizes C++, and I wanted to gain a stronger foundation in the language.
C++ handles OOP pretty simillar to Java, in that you can create classes with instance variables, a constructor, and methods. It is a bit different with header files establishing what is in the class, and the cpp file having
the actual implementation of the methods. The file ingestion was a bit more involved than other languages I have used, using an ifstream to parse each line. Conditional statements were very simillar to other languages I have used, 
both the if/else blocks and the ternary operators. Assignment statements work simillar, except if you are trying to assign a value to something you are pointing to, you have to use the '->' operator to change it's value instead of the 
= sign. Loops work exactly the same. The main different from Java was the use of references when passing in arguments to methods.
  My project used some libraries, specifically the Standard Template Library (STL), the iostream library, and the sstream library. The standard template library is important for data structures (std::vector, std::unordered_map), algorithms
(std::any_of), and iterators for iterating over the data structures. iostream is useful for std::ifstream to get file input, and std::cout for outputing to console. sstream was used for std::stringstream, which allowed me to parse and manipulate
a string object.
